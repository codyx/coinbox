Coinbox is an open-source experimental application, which is my first submission for the Arweave open web hackathon.

You will need an Arweave wallet to use the features of this app. You can get one here: https://tokens.arweave.org/

You can use this app to test your prediction skills on the change of crypto markets prices.

## Features

- Login through Arweave
- Make crypto predictions and store them in the Arweave blockchain
- See your predictions results

### How to use the app

The app runs on the Arweave blockchain.
You can access the [live demo](https://or6tq2g7ef6f.arweave.net/ZTe6-l85_LAY_x3LIpt9nMXbgL26HksdxeaWsXIKjLk/index.html).

1. Login with your Arweave wallet
2. Click on New Prediction and place a new prediction on the coin you want. Data feed is provided by Coinbase Pro.
3. That's it. Wait for your prediction to expire and come back to the app to see if you were right!

###### NOTE

1. As predictions live on the blockchain, when you make a new prediction it has to be mined into the blockchain (this process usually takes < 5min). Therefore, **you'll have to wait a little bit before seeing your prediction on the app**.

2. If the app is showing "no liquidity" on a prediction, it either means (a) there was no liquidity for this coin at the moment of entry or expiration or (b) there is no candle available yet (wait a little bit).

3. This app is a simple prototype and not a real-world application, so several improvements are doable (responsive design especially for mobiles devices, cache, tests, etc) and bugs might exist.
